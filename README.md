# Inventory

Currently INSECURE (due to debugging allowances in the config - make sure to change them back to restricted access)

Hi. This Inventory project is a customized template implementation and project development based on the express mongoose templates
floating around, particularly adapted from a grab circa 2022 from RainEggplant's template which was adapted from cdimascio's
template.

The template has been fleshed out for our purposes: quick and dirty inventory system for some BOM mgmt for assembly.

It's pretty gross and incomplete. 

Please see templates:

## TODO - Running list

- componentType: add abbreviation / ed version for BOM lists - or virtual
- maybe disable the _id and __v fields?
- show ALL fields for component edit view (need to send that from controller too)
- distributor routes controller and services - or if enum handle show this stuff
- solve the forever yarn dev loading / reloading process
- add nvm use to launch script? or similar - script would be better to check and then run etc.


- BOM detail: 
  - Manually create timestamps on data import for componentSelectionEvents because not working in mongoose (parent doesn't have timestamps - maybe it is that kind of bug?)
  


## TODO BAD HUMAN LONG TERMS

- auth!!
- tests!!

## TODO (Cautions) Before Dist or Deploy or whatever

- debugger script in package.json set to allow any public IP address for remote debugging!! (so remove the IP addy in the --inspect clause)

## DEV

- To kill the still-open inspect process on auto relaunch after file save or even just relaunch manually:
  - ```fuser -k 9221/tcp```

## Quick Start

Get started developing...

You need to create a `.env` file and configure your database at first, then set up the database and start developing / testing.

```shell
# install deps
yarn install

# run in development mode
yarn dev

# run tests
yarn test

# check code styles
yarn lint

# check type errors
yarn typecheck
```

---

## Install Dependencies

Install all package dependencies (one time operation)

```shell
yarn install
```

## Run It

#### Run in _development_ mode:

Runs the application is development mode. Should not be used in production

```shell
yarn dev
```

or debug it

```shell
yarn dev:debug
```

#### Run in _production_ mode:

Compiles the application and starts it in production mode

```shell
yarn compile
yarn start
```

## Test It

Run the Mocha unit tests

```shell
yarn test
```

or debug them

```shell
yarn test:debug
```

Run the tests and output a JUnit-style XML test results file at `./test/test-results.xml`

```shell
yarn test:junit
```

## Try It

Make sure the database is running

- Open you're browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Invoke the `/examples` endpoint
  ```shell
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/examples
  ```

## Debug It

#### Debug the server:

```
yarn dev:debug
```

#### Debug Tests

```
yarn test:debug
```

#### Debug with VSCode

Use the configurations in `.vscode/launch.json` file

## Lint It

Check types and fix all linter errors

Check code styles

```shell
yarn lint
yarn lint:fix  # fix linter errors as well
```

Check type error

```
yarn typecheck
```
